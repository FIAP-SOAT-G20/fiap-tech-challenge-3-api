<summary>Project Structure Explanation</summary>

### **1️⃣ Core (Innermost layer)**

- `domain/`: Central business entities and rules.
- `dto/`: Data transfer objects.
- `port/`: Interfaces that define contracts between layers, ensuring independence.
- `usecase/`: Application use cases.

### **2️⃣ Adapter (Middle layer)**

- `controller/`: Coordinates the flow of data between use cases and infrastructure.
- `presenter/`: Formats data for presentation.
- `gateway/`: Implements access to data from external sources (databases, APIs, etc.).

### **3️⃣ Infrastructure (External layer)**

- `config/`: Application configuration management.
- `database/`: Configuration and connection to the database. 
- `datasource/`: Concrete implementations of data sources.
- `handler/`: Handling of HTTP requests.
- `httpclient/`: HTTP client for external requests.
- `logger/`: Structured logger for detailed logs.
- `middleware/`: HTTP middlewares for handling requests.
- `route/`: Definition of API routes.
- `server/`: Initialization of the HTTP server.
- `service/`: Infra level services.

</details>

### :bulb: Decisions

- **Clean Architecture structure**: The project was structured using the Clean Architecture pattern, which aims to separate the application into layers, making it easier to maintain and test. The project is divided into three layers: Core, Adapter, and Infrastructure.
- **Presenter**: The presenter (from Adapter layer) was created to format the data to be returned to the client. This layer is responsible for transforming the data into the desired format, such as JSON, XML, etc. Also, it is responsible for handling errors and returning the appropriate HTTP status code.
- **Use Case**: The use case (from Core layer) was created to define the business rules of the application. This layer is responsible for orchestrating the flow of data between the entities and the data sources.
- **Middleware to handle errors**: A middleware was created to handle errors and return the appropriate HTTP status code. This middleware is responsible for catching errors and returning the appropriate response to the client.
- **Structured Logger**: A structured logger was created to provide detailed logs. This logger is responsible for logging information about the application, such as requests, responses, errors, etc.
- **Database Connection**: The database connection was created using GORM, a popular ORM library for Go. This library provides an easy way to interact with the database and perform CRUD operations.
- **Database Migrations**: Database migrations were created to manage the database schema. This allows us to version control the database schema and apply changes to the database in a structured way.
- **HTTP Server**: The HTTP server was created using the Gin framework, a lightweight web framework for Go. This framework provides a fast and easy way to create web applications in Go.
- **Mock Payment Gateway**: A mock payment gateway was created with Mockoon (docker) to simulate the payment process. This mock server is used to test the payment process without interacting with the real payment gateway. We have tested the integration with the Mercado Pago API, but we are using the mock server to simulate the payment gateway validation, avoiding the need to expose the Mercado Pago API credentials, and to simplify the validation, because our mock server can access our webhook directly.

## :scroll: Requirements

### Build/Run with Docker

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

### Build/Run Locally (development)

- [Go](https://golang.org/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

> [!WARNING]
> You need to have Go version **1.24 or higher** installed on your machine to run the application locally


<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## :cd: Installation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/FIAP-SOAT-G20/FIAP-TechChallenge-Fase2.git
```

```sh
cd FIAP-TechChallenge-Fase2
```

Set the environment variables

```sh
cp .env.example .env
```

### :whale: Docker

```sh
make compose-build
```

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## :runner: Running

> [!IMPORTANT]
> After running the application, a mock server container will be created to simulate the payment gateway.  
> When you create a new payment (with `POST payments/:order_id/checkout`) the order status will be updated from `OPEN` to `PENDING`,  
> then the mock server will call the webhook `POST payments/callback`,  
> and the order status will be updated from `PENDING` to `RECEIVED`.  
> You can verify mock server logs by running `docker logs mockserver.10soat-g18.dev`.

> [!TIP]
> We have created a step-by-step guide to test the application, you can find it [here](docs/tc2-validation-testing.md).  
>
> API Documentation will be available at:
>
> - Swagger:
>   - Docker: <http://localhost:8080/docs/index.html>
>   - K8s: <http://localhost/docs/index.html>
> - Postman collection: [here](docs/postman_collection.json)
> - [Rest Client](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client): [here](docs/tc2.http)

### :whale: Docker

```sh
make compose-up
```

> [!TIP]
> To stop the application, run `compose-down`  
> To remove the application, run `compose-clean`  

> [!NOTE]
> The application will be available at <http://localhost:8080>
> Ex: <http://localhost:8080/api/v1/health>


<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### :gear: Kubernetes

```bash
make k8s-apply
```

> The resources will be created in the `tech-challenge-system` namespace

> [!TIP]
> To view the application, run `make k8s-status` or `kubectl get all -n tech-challenge-system`  
> To remove the application, run `make k8s-delete`

> [!NOTE]
> The application will be available at <http://localhost>  
> Ex: <http://localhost/api/v1/health>

### :mag: Kubernetes Organization

The Kubernetes organization is divided into three main directories: `app`, `config`, and `postgres`.

- **app**: Contains the Kubernetes resources for the application, such as deployment, service, ingress, and HPA.
- **config**: Contains the Kubernetes resources for the configuration, such as ConfigMap and Secret.
- **mockserver**: Contains the Kubernetes resources for the Mock Server, such as deployment, service, and HPA.
- **postgres**: Contains the Kubernetes resources for the PostgreSQL database, such as StatefulSet and Service.

```sh
.
├── app
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── hpa.yaml
│   ├── ingress.yaml
│   └── service.yaml
├── config
│   ├── configmap.yaml
│   └── secret.yaml
├── mockserver
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── hpa.yaml
│   └── service.yaml
├── namespace.yaml
└── postgres
    ├── service.yaml
    └── statefulset.yaml
```

## :hammer_and_wrench: Development

1. Install Go: https://golang.org/doc/install
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/FIAP-SOAT-G20/FIAP-TechChallenge-Fase2`
3. Change to the project directory: `cd FIAP-TechChallenge-Fase2`
4. Checkout to the development branch: `make new-branch`
5. Set the environment variables: `cp .env.example .env`
6. Install dependencies by running `make install`
7. Run the application by running `make run-air` or `make run`
8. Access the application at `http://localhost:8080`
9. Make your changes 🧑‍💻
10. Dont forget to run the tests by running `make test`
11. Check the coverage report by running `make coverage`
12. Check the lint by running `make lint`
13. Update the swagger documentation by running `make swagger`
14. Commit your changes following the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standard
15. Push to the branch and Open a new PR by running `make pull-request`
16. The GitHub Actions will run the tests, lint and vulnerability check automatically
17. After the PR is approved, merge it to the main branch
18. Generate a new `release` tag ([here](https://github.com/FIAP-SOAT-G20/FIAP-TechChallenge-Fase2/releases/new)) with [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)
<!-- 19. The Kubernetes deployment will be updated automatically -->

> [!TIP]
> 7: `make run` will run the application locally, and will build and run PostgreSQL container using Docker Compose  
> Alternatively, you can run `make run-air` to run the application using Air (live reload)

> [!TIP]
> 18: When a new `release` tag is created, the GitHub Actions will build and push the image to the  
> GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) from GitHub Packages,  
> the image will be available at `ghcr.io/fiap-soat-g20/fiap-techchallenge-fase2:latest`  
> About semantic versioning:  
> if you are fixing bugs, increment the patch version (v0.0.1)  
> if you are adding new features, increment the minor version (v0.1.0)  
> if you are changing the API, increment the major version (v1.0.0)
